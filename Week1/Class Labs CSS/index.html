		<p style="color:green">Runway Passport asked a group of fashion bloggers from around the world what they would wear if they were going to have lunch with Carine Roitfeld and Anna Wintour.</p>

		<p>”Lol, good question. I would wear whatever I felt like that day, probably something classic with a vintage bag or accessory.”<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;– Adrianna Kinel of AA Kinal from Melbourne, Australia</p>
			

			<p style="color:orange">“I’d keep it simple with a crisp white blouse and a full high-waisted black skirt.”<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;– Carly A. Heitlinger of The College Prepster from New York</p>
